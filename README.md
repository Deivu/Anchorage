### Installing

* Command Line
```
cargo add --git https://github.com/Deivu/Anchorage.git
```

* Add it to `Cargo.toml`
```
anchorage = { git = "https://github.com/Deivu/Anchorage.git", version = "0.1.0" }
```

### Examples

* Starting the library

```rs
use anchorage::Anchorage;
use anchorage::model::player::{DataType, EventType, PlayerEvents};
use anchorage::model::anchorage::{Options, NodeOptions, ConnectionOptions};

/// supplying none on these options defaults it to it's default value
let anchorage = Anchorage::new(Options {
    user_agent: None,
    reconnect_tries: None,
    request: None,
});

let nodes = vec![NodeOptions { 
    name: "Anchorage",
    host: "127.0.0.1",
    port: 8080,
    auth: "password_you_want",
}]

let user_id: u64 = 424137718961012737;

anchorage
    .start(user_id, nodes)
    .await
    .unwrap();

/// now you can use anchorage as you wish
```

* Joining a voice channel. This is dependent on whatever library you are using (if you are using one), Just ensure that you fill up [`ConnectionOptions`] properly with the data you received from your Discord gateway
```rs
/// assuming we are using the (anchorage) instance above

/// guild id of the guild where the bot will join the voice channel
let guild_id: u64 = 423116740810244097;

/// voice data you received from your gateway
let connection = ConnectionOptions {
    channel_id: Some(564749582744027156),
    endpoint: "https://discord.com/some_voice_endpoint",
    guild_id,
    session_id: "some_session_id_from_discord",
    token: "some_token_from_disord",
    user_id: 424137718961012737,
};

/// shortcut to get an idean node to connect to
let node = anchorage.get_ideal_node()
    .await
    .unwrap();

/// creates a new player where you can communicate with lavalink and receive events via a message channel
let (player, events) = anchorage.create_player(guild_id, node, connection)
    .await
    .unwrap();

/// handle player and events as you wish
```

* Playing a track and handling events
```rs
/// assuming that we are using the using the (node, player, events) instance from above

/// tries to resolve a track that returns DataType enum
let result = node.rest.resolve("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KheS1qj4fyk")
    .await
    .unwrap();


/// match the enum depending on the result
let tracks = match result {
    DataType::Track(track) => vec![track],
    _ => vec![]
}

if tracks.len() == 0 {
    return;
}

/// spawn a new green thread to handle your player events so you wont block the current thread you are on
tokio::spawn(async move {
    let event = events.recv_async().await.unwrap();
    
    match event {
        EventType::Player(player_events) => {
        
            match player_events {
                PlayerEvents::TrackStartEvent(_) => {
                    /// do something
                }
                _ => {
                    /// additional player events
                }
            }
            
        }
        EventType::Destroyed => {
            /// clean up your player as the node where this player is destroyed, or move your player, your call
        }
    }
});

/// play the resolved track
player.play(tracks[0].encoded.clone()).await.unwrap();
```

### Notes

* As you noticed, I used `.unwrap()` on most of these calls, but you'd want to handle the errors properly
* Anchorage is async, most of her calls won't block your current thread
